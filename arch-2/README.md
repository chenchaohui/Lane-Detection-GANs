# Architecture 2
Check performance of the network by adding in batch normalization for all layers, adding skip layers, and trying strides of 2 instead of max pooling.

## Summary
1. Attempted models with each of these individually
   - No pooling (replaced by strides of 2x2 over max pooling)
   - More batch normalization
   - Adding skip layers
   - Combination of the above
