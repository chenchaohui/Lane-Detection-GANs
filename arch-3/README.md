# Architecture 3
Check performance gained when using an ImageNet pretrained architecture (Inception, ResNet, etc.) as the encoder part of the network, with a similar decoder structure as before for the semantic inference.

**Note: The trained model files are not included within this repository due to file size >100 MB.**

## Summary
1. Used ResNet for the encoder portion of the structure
